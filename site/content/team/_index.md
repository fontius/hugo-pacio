Pacio will empower applications to realise the capability of decentralised technologies to provide safer, more inclusive, fairer, more productive, lower cost systems and new opportunities for society, business and government.

Pacio will do this by supplying a platform that extends decentralised technologies to make them suitable for widespread use by applications, wherever the apps run. Pacio will add broad accounting, management, and semantic data functionalities that are interoperable across entities, jurisdictions, standards, apps, and blockchains, plus a cryptocurrency with a purpose, comprehensive governance capabilities, and an ecosystem of tools and services.
